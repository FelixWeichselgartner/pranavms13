Servus! My name is Felix Weichselgartner and I'm an Electrical Engineering and student from Lower Bavaria in Germany. Beside my study at the [Landshut University of Applied Sciences](https://www.haw-landshut.de/) I'm working as a software engineer for [Jungheinrich AG](https://www.jungheinrich.de/) in the department of automated guided vehicles. In my spare time I like to program and do different electrical projects. However, I also enjoy playing video games, skiing and reading.
